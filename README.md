# textforensics
Clojure program to perform NLP tasks such as finding names, locations, amounts, times, nouns, etc. from text.

## Instructions  
The program contains individual functions to get the name, location, time, date, amount, percentage, organization, verbs, and nouns mentioned in a text. These functions can be called using the REPL or running the main function provides an output containing all the functions for testing. Furthermore, the program also has functions to find the n most frequent words in a given text after removing stop words like "a, this, that, the, it, etc."

###Note
The tasks in the program were performed using [clojure-opennlp](https://github.com/dakrone/clojure-opennlp). The required dependencies are included in the *resources* folder.
